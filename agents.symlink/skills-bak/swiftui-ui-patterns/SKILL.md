# SwiftUI UI Patterns

## Quick start

Choose a track based on your goal:

### Existing project

- Identify the feature or screen and the primary interaction model (list, detail, editor, settings, tabbed).
- Find a nearby example in the repo with `rg "TabView\("` or similar, then read the closest SwiftUI view.
- Apply local conventions: prefer SwiftUI-native state, keep state local when possible, and use environment injection for shared dependencies.
- Choose the relevant component reference from `references/components-index.md` and follow its guidance.
- Build the view with small, focused subviews and SwiftUI-native data flow.

### New project scaffolding

- Start with `references/app-scaffolding-wiring.md` to wire TabView + NavigationStack + sheets.
- Add a minimal `AppTab` and `RouterPath` based on the provided skeletons.
- Choose the next component reference based on the UI you need first (TabView, NavigationStack, Sheets).
- Expand the route and sheet enums as new screens are added.

## General rules to follow

- Use modern SwiftUI state (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@Observable`, `@Environment`) and avoid unnecessary view models.
- Prefer composition; keep views small and focused.
- Use async/await with `.task` and explicit loading/error states.
- Maintain existing legacy patterns only when editing legacy files.
- Follow the project's formatter and style guide.

## Workflow for a new SwiftUI view

1. Define the view's state and its ownership location.
2. Identify dependencies to inject via `@Environment`.
3. Sketch the view hierarchy and extract repeated parts into subviews.
4. Implement async loading with `.task` and explicit state enum if needed.
5. Add accessibility labels or identifiers when the UI is interactive.
6. Validate with a build and update usage callsites if needed.

## Component references

Use `references/components-index.md` as the entry point. Each component reference should include:
- Intent and best-fit scenarios.
- Minimal usage pattern with local conventions.
- Pitfalls and performance notes.
- Paths to existing examples in the current repo.

## Adding a new component reference

- Create `references/<component>.md`.
- Keep it short and actionable; link to concrete files in the current repo.
- Update `references/components-index.md` with the new entry.
