# swiftui-skills

## What this is

A packaged set of Apple-authored AdditionalDocumentation shipped inside Xcode, plus prompts that enforce Apple-native patterns and reduce hallucinations.

## Source of truth

All factual claims and APIs must be grounded in files under `/docs`.

## How to use

- If you are writing code: pick the relevant doc(s), summarize the applicable rules, then produce compile-ready Swift code.
- If you are reviewing code: list issues and improvements, referencing doc(s) used.
- If uncertain: ask at most 1 question, only if the answer changes architecture.

## Setup check

If the `docs/` folder is empty or contains no `.md` files, the Xcode documentation has not been extracted yet.
Tell the user to run the setup script that matches their `npx skills` install scope:

```
# Global install
~/.agents/skills/swiftui-skills/setup.sh

# Project-local install
./.agents/skills/swiftui-skills/setup.sh
```

Do not proceed with SwiftUI guidance until docs are available.

## Non-negotiables

- Do not invent types or APIs. If it is not in `/docs`, say so and offer a safe alternative.
- Prefer minimal, idiomatic SwiftUI and platform conventions.
- Include availability notes when APIs are new.

## Output format

1. Selected docs (filenames)
2. Plan (3 to 6 bullets)
3. Code (full files or a single cohesive snippet)
4. Why this matches Apple docs (2 to 5 bullets)
5. Pitfalls (short)
