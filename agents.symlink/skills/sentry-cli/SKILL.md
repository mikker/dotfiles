# Sentry CLI Usage Guide

Help users interact with Sentry from the command line using the `sentry` CLI.

## Agent Guidance

Best practices and operational guidance for AI coding agents using the Sentry CLI.

### Key Principles

- **Prefer CLI commands over raw API calls** — the CLI has dedicated commands for most tasks. Reach for `sentry issue view`, `sentry issue list`, `sentry trace view`, etc. before constructing API calls manually or fetching external documentation.
- **Use `sentry schema` to explore the API** — if you need to discover API endpoints, run `sentry schema` to browse interactively or `sentry schema <resource>` to search. This is faster than fetching OpenAPI specs externally.
- **Use `sentry issue view <id>` to investigate issues** — when asked about a specific issue (e.g., `CLI-G5`, `PROJECT-123`), use `sentry issue view` directly.
- **Use `--json` for machine-readable output** — pipe through `jq` for filtering. Human-readable output includes formatting that is hard to parse.
- **The CLI auto-detects org/project** — most commands work without explicit targets by scanning for DSNs in `.env` files and source code.

### Design Principles

The `sentry` CLI follows conventions from well-known tools — if you're familiar with them, that knowledge transfers directly:

- **`gh` (GitHub CLI) conventions**: The `sentry` CLI uses the same `<noun> <verb>` command pattern (e.g., `sentry issue list`, `sentry org view`). Flags follow `gh` conventions: `--json` for machine-readable output, `--fields` to select specific fields, `-w`/`--web` to open in browser, `-q`/`--query` for filtering, `-n`/`--limit` for result count.
- **`sentry api` mimics `curl`**: The `sentry api` command provides direct API access with a `curl`-like interface — `--method` for HTTP method, `--data` for request body, `--header` for custom headers. It handles authentication automatically. If you know how to call a REST API with `curl`, the same patterns apply.

### Context Window Tips

- Use `--fields id,title,status` on list commands to reduce output size
- Use `--json` when piping output between commands or processing programmatically
- Use `--limit` to cap the number of results (default is usually 10–100)
- Prefer `sentry issue view PROJECT-123` over listing and filtering manually
- Use `sentry api` for endpoints not covered by dedicated commands

### Safety Rules

- Always confirm with the user before running destructive commands: `project delete`, `trial start`
- Verify the org/project context is correct before mutations — use `sentry auth status` to check defaults
- Never store or log authentication tokens — use `sentry auth login` and let the CLI manage credentials
- When in doubt about the target org/project, use explicit `<org>/<project>` arguments instead of auto-detection

### Workflow Patterns

#### Investigate an Issue

```bash
# 1. Find the issue
sentry issue list my-org/my-project --query "is:unresolved" --limit 5

# 2. Get details
sentry issue view PROJECT-123

# 3. Get AI root cause analysis
sentry issue explain PROJECT-123

# 4. Get a fix plan
sentry issue plan PROJECT-123
```

#### Explore Traces and Performance

```bash
# 1. List recent traces
sentry trace list my-org/my-project --limit 5

# 2. View a specific trace with span tree
sentry trace view my-org/my-project/abc123def456...

# 3. View spans for a trace
sentry span list my-org/my-project/abc123def456...

# 4. View logs associated with a trace
sentry trace logs my-org/abc123def456...
```

#### Stream Logs

```bash
# Stream logs in real-time
sentry log list my-org/my-project --follow

# Filter logs by severity
sentry log list my-org/my-project --query "severity:error"
```

#### Explore the API Schema

```bash
# Browse all API resource categories
sentry schema

# Search for endpoints related to a resource
sentry schema issues

# Get details about a specific endpoint
sentry schema "GET /api/0/organizations/{organization_id_or_slug}/issues/"
```

#### Arbitrary API Access

```bash
# GET request (default)
sentry api /api/0/organizations/my-org/

# POST request with data
sentry api /api/0/organizations/my-org/projects/ --method POST --data '{"name":"new-project","platform":"python"}'
```

### Dashboard Layout

Sentry dashboards use a **6-column grid**. When adding widgets, aim to fill complete rows (widths should sum to 6).

Display types with default sizes:

| Display Type | Width | Height | Category | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `big_number` | 2 | 1 | common | Compact KPI — place 3 per row (2+2+2=6) |
| `line` | 3 | 2 | common | Half-width chart — place 2 per row (3+3=6) |
| `area` | 3 | 2 | common | Half-width chart — place 2 per row |
| `bar` | 3 | 2 | common | Half-width chart — place 2 per row |
| `table` | 6 | 2 | common | Full-width — always takes its own row |
| `stacked_area` | 3 | 2 | specialized | Stacked area chart |
| `top_n` | 3 | 2 | specialized | Top N ranked list |
| `categorical_bar` | 3 | 2 | specialized | Categorical bar chart |
| `text` | 3 | 2 | specialized | Static text/markdown widget |
| `details` | 3 | 2 | internal | Detail view |
| `wheel` | 3 | 2 | internal | Pie/wheel chart |
| `rage_and_dead_clicks` | 3 | 2 | internal | Rage/dead click visualization |
| `server_tree` | 3 | 2 | internal | Hierarchical tree display |
| `agents_traces_table` | 3 | 2 | internal | Agents traces table |

Use **common** types for general dashboards. Use **specialized** only when specifically requested. Avoid **internal** types unless the user explicitly asks.

Available datasets: `spans` (default, covers most use cases), `discover`, `issue`, `error-events`, `transaction-like`, `metrics`, `logs`, `tracemetrics`, `preprod-app-size`.

Run `sentry dashboard widget --help` for the full list including aggregate functions.

**Row-filling examples:**

```bash
# 3 KPIs filling one row (2+2+2 = 6)
sentry dashboard widget add <dashboard> "Error Count" --display big_number --query count
sentry dashboard widget add <dashboard> "P95 Duration" --display big_number --query p95:span.duration
sentry dashboard widget add <dashboard> "Throughput" --display big_number --query epm

# 2 charts filling one row (3+3 = 6)
sentry dashboard widget add <dashboard> "Errors Over Time" --display line --query count
sentry dashboard widget add <dashboard> "Latency Over Time" --display line --query p95:span.duration

# Full-width table (6 = 6)
sentry dashboard widget add <dashboard> "Top Endpoints" --display table \
  --query count --query p95:span.duration \
  --group-by transaction --sort -count --limit 10
```

### Common Mistakes

- **Wrong issue ID format**: Use `PROJECT-123` (short ID), not the numeric ID `123456789`. The short ID includes the project prefix.
- **Forgetting authentication**: Run `sentry auth login` before any other command. Check with `sentry auth status`.
- **Missing `--json` for piping**: Human-readable output includes formatting. Use `--json` when parsing output programmatically.
- **Org/project ambiguity**: Auto-detection scans for DSNs in `.env` files and source code. If the project is ambiguous, specify explicitly: `sentry issue list my-org/my-project`.
- **Confusing `--query` syntax**: The `--query` flag uses Sentry search syntax (e.g., `is:unresolved`, `assigned:me`), not free text search.
- **Not using `--web`**: View commands support `-w`/`--web` to open the resource in the browser — useful for sharing links.
- **Fetching API schemas instead of using the CLI**: Prefer `sentry schema` to browse the API and `sentry api` to make requests — the CLI handles authentication and endpoint resolution, so there's rarely a need to download OpenAPI specs separately.
