  Guides Stripe integration decisions — API selection (Checkout Sessions vs
  PaymentIntents), Connect platform setup (Accounts v2, controller properties),
  billing/subscriptions, Treasury financial accounts, integration surfaces
  (Checkout, Payment Element), and migrating from deprecated Stripe APIs. Use
  when building, modifying, or reviewing any Stripe integration — including
  accepting payments, building marketplaces, integrating Stripe, processing
  payments, setting up subscriptions, or creating connected accounts.

Latest Stripe API version: **2026-03-25.dahlia**. Always use the latest API version and SDK unless the user specifies otherwise.
