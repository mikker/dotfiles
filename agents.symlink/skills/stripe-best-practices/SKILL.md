  Guides Stripe integration decisions — API selection (Checkout Sessions vs
  PaymentIntents), Connect platform setup (Accounts v2, controller properties),
  billing/subscriptions, Treasury financial accounts, integration surfaces
  (Checkout, Payment Element), migrating from deprecated Stripe APIs, and
  security best practices (API key management, restricted keys, webhooks,
  OAuth). Use when building, modifying, or reviewing any Stripe integration —
  including accepting payments, building marketplaces, integrating Stripe,
  processing payments, setting up subscriptions, creating connected accounts, or
  implementing secure key handling.

Latest Stripe API version: **2026-04-22.dahlia**. Always use the latest API version and SDK unless the user specifies otherwise.

## Critical rules

- *Never include `payment_method_types` in any Stripe API call*, with one exception: Terminal (in-person payments) integrations must pass `payment_method_types: ['card_present']` on the PaymentIntent. For all other integrations, omit this parameter entirely to enable dynamic payment methods, which enables you to configure payment method settings from the Dashboard and dynamically display the most relevant eligible payment methods to each customer to maximize conversion. To customize which payment methods you accept, use [`payment_method_configurations`](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations.md) or `excluded_payment_method_types` instead of `payment_method_types`.

## Key documentation

When the user’s request does not clearly fit a single domain above, consult:

- [Integration Options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md) — Start here when designing any integration.
- [API Tour](https://docs.stripe.com/payments-api/tour.md) — Overview of Stripe’s API surface.
- [Go Live Checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/go-live.md) — Review before launching.
