# Pointer Authentication

Pointer authentication protects against control-flow hijacking attacks by signing pointers with cryptographic metadata and verifying the signatures before use.

> **Apple developer documentation:** [Preparing your app to work with pointer authentication](doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Security/preparing-your-app-to-work-with-pointer-authentication).

## What It Does

When enabled, the build system adds an **arm64e** slice — it appends `arm64e` to `ARCHS_STANDARD` alongside the existing `arm64`, so the target builds both slices — and arm64e enables pointer authentication. The system:

1. Generates signature metadata for pointers your app creates (memory allocation, C++ object construction)
2. Validates that signatures are unchanged when your app accesses memory through those pointers
3. Crashes your app if a pointer's signature is invalid

This prevents an attacker from overwriting function pointers or return addresses to redirect your app's control flow.

## What Vulnerabilities It Mitigates

- **Control-flow hijacking** — overwriting function pointers, vtable pointers, or return addresses
- **ROP/JOP attacks** — chaining existing code gadgets by corrupting pointer values
- **Code injection via pointer corruption** — modifying data pointers to point to attacker-controlled memory

## How to Enable

**Xcode UI:** Signing & Capabilities > Enhanced Security > check "Authenticate Pointers"

**Build setting:** `ENABLE_POINTER_AUTHENTICATION = Yes`

This is enabled by default when you add the Enhanced Security capability.

For detailed usage, see [Improving control flow integrity with pointer authentication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Apple-Silicon/improving-control-flow-integrity-with-pointer-authentication).

## How to Disable

**Xcode UI:** Uncheck "Authenticate Pointers" in the Enhanced Security capability

**Build setting:** `ENABLE_POINTER_AUTHENTICATION = No`

## Swift Package Manager Support

Swift Package dependencies are not automatically built for arm64e when the main project enables pointer authentication. To build SPM packages with arm64e, set workspace-level flags in the project's embedded workspace settings.

For a `.xcodeproj` (which contains an implicit workspace at `MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/`):

```bash
plutil -create xml1 MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
plutil -insert iOSPackagesShouldBuildARM64e -bool YES MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
plutil -insert macOSPackagesShouldBuildARM64e -bool YES MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
plutil -insert visionOSPackagesShouldBuildARM64e -bool YES MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
```

For a standalone `.xcworkspace`:

```bash
plutil -create xml1 MyWorkspace.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
plutil -insert iOSPackagesShouldBuildARM64e -bool YES MyWorkspace.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
plutil -insert macOSPackagesShouldBuildARM64e -bool YES MyWorkspace.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
plutil -insert visionOSPackagesShouldBuildARM64e -bool YES MyWorkspace.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings
```

Set the flags for each platform your project targets.

For binary SPM dependencies (XCFrameworks), the XCFramework must include an arm64e slice. If it only contains arm64, linking will fail. Contact the dependency vendor for a universal (arm64 + arm64e) build.

## Library and Framework Authors

Pointer authentication is **highly recommended** for libraries and frameworks distributed to other developers (e.g. a Swift Package, CocoaPod, or `.xcframework`). Enabling it already builds a **universal binary** — `arm64e` is appended alongside `arm64`, so the artifact contains both slices and consumers pick whichever matches their own build. For a distributed target, just make sure the shipped (Release) configuration builds the full arch list (`ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH = NO`); optionally pin `ARCHS = "arm64 arm64e"` at target level as belt-and-suspenders to keep both slices independent of the pointer-authentication cascade. Do not disable pointer authentication on the library to avoid the larger artifact; the size increase is the accepted tradeoff for control-flow integrity in shipped library code, and only one slice is loaded at runtime. See `universal-binaries-for-libraries.md` for the full recipe, qualifying product types, and XCFramework guidance.

## Platform Availability

**Platforms that support arm64e:**
- iOS / iPadOS (SDKROOT: `iphoneos`)
- macOS (SDKROOT: `macosx`)
- visionOS (SDKROOT: `xros`)
- DriverKit (SDKROOT: `driverkit`)
- tvOS (SDKROOT: `appletvos`)
- watchOS (SDKROOT: `watchos`)

Every device platform defines an `arm64e` architecture and carries `arm64` in `ARCHS_STANDARD`, so enabling pointer authentication appends an `arm64e` slice on each of them — the build system treats them identically.

**Platforms that do NOT support arm64e:**
- Simulator (any `*simulator` SDKROOT) — the simulator SDKs define no `arm64e` architecture.

When `ENABLE_ENHANCED_SECURITY = YES` cascades `ENABLE_POINTER_AUTHENTICATION = YES` project-wide, `arm64e` is appended to the architecture list for every destination whose `ARCHS_STANDARD` contains `arm64`. This is safe for the Simulator with **no action required**: simulator SDKs define no `arm64e` architecture, so the build system drops `arm64e` from a simulator build's effective architectures automatically. The simulator slice simply builds as `arm64` (plus `x86_64`) without pointer authentication, while device builds still get the `arm64e` slice. Do **not** add an `ENABLE_POINTER_AUTHENTICATION = NO` override for the simulator: it is unnecessary, an unconditional one would also disable pointer authentication on device builds, and the SDK-conditional form (`ENABLE_POINTER_AUTHENTICATION[sdk=*simulator*] = NO`) can't be written by `UpdateTargetBuildSetting` (no conditional support) or entered in Xcode's Build Settings UI anyway.

## Performance and Stability Impact

- **Performance:** Low overhead. Pointer signing/verification is done in hardware.
- **Stability:** Code that manipulates raw pointers, casts between function pointer types, or uses inline assembly with pointers may crash. Test thoroughly.
- **Compatibility:** arm64e binaries are separate from arm64. Need to rebuild dependencies as arm64e. **If there are binary dependencies that you don't have the source code for, you will need to reach out to your dependency vendor to get a universal (arm64 and arm64e) version of the dependency.
