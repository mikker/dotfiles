# Typed Allocators

> **Apple developer documentation:** [Adopting type-aware memory allocation](doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Xcode/adopting-type-aware-memory-allocation).

Typed allocator support has two complementary pieces that can be enabled separately but are most effective in combination:

1. **Entitlement ([`com.apple.security.hardened-process.hardened-heap`](doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.security.hardened-process.hardened-heap))** — adds extra type-isolation buckets to the allocator at runtime, regardless of compiler settings. This provides baseline type isolation.
2. **Build settings (`CLANG_ENABLE_C_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT`, `CLANG_ENABLE_CPLUSPLUS_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT`)** — the compiler communicates type information to the allocator, allowing it to do a better job isolating different types and improving protection against use-after-free vulnerabilities.

Both are enabled by default when you add the Enhanced Security capability (the entitlement as a default-ON sub-option, the build settings as cascaded settings).

## What It Does

When the build settings are enabled, the compiler tracks the intended type of memory allocations. This means that `malloc`, `calloc`, and similar allocator functions produce pointers that carry type information. Combined with the `hardened-heap` sub-option's runtime type-isolation buckets, this makes it harder for an attacker to exploit type confusion vulnerabilities where memory allocated for one type is used as another.

## What Vulnerabilities It Mitigates

- **Type confusion** — treating a pointer to type A as a pointer to type B after allocation
- **Allocator-based exploitation** — abusing custom allocator wrappers to bypass type safety

## How to Enable

**Xcode UI:** Signing & Capabilities > Enhanced Security > check "Enable Typed Allocators"

**Build settings:**
- C code: `CLANG_ENABLE_C_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT = Yes`
- C++ code: `CLANG_ENABLE_CPLUSPLUS_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT = Yes`

**Entitlement:** `com.apple.security.hardened-process.hardened-heap`

All are enabled by default when you add the Enhanced Security capability (build settings are cascaded by `ENABLE_ENHANCED_SECURITY`; entitlement is a default-ON sub-option).

## Code Changes Required

If your code uses **custom memory-allocator wrapper functions**, you may need to update them to propagate type information. Standard `malloc`/`free` usage typically requires no changes.

For details on updating custom allocators, see [Adopting type-aware memory allocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adopting-type-aware-memory-allocation).

## How to Disable

**Build settings:**
- C: `CLANG_ENABLE_C_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT = No`
- C++: `CLANG_ENABLE_CPLUSPLUS_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT = No`

**Xcode UI:** Uncheck "Enable Typed Allocators" in the Enhanced Security capability.

## Platform Availability

- iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS
- Available on all supported hardware

## Performance and Stability Impact

- **Performance:** Minimal overhead — type tracking is primarily a compile-time mechanism.
- **Stability:** Custom allocator wrappers may need updates. Standard allocator usage is unaffected.
