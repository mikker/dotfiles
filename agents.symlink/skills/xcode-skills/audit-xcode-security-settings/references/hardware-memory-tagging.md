# Hardware Memory Tagging

Hardware memory tagging (Memory Integrity Enforcement) uses ARM Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to detect use-after-free and out-of-bounds memory access at runtime.

> **Apple developer documentation:** entitlement reference for [`com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations`](doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations) (and its sub-options [`soft-mode`](doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations.soft-mode), [`enable-pure-data`](doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations.enable-pure-data), [`no-tagged-receive`](doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations.no-tagged-receive)).

## What It Does

Each memory allocation and pointer receives an embedded **tag** value. When your app accesses memory through a pointer, the hardware checks that the pointer's tag matches the allocation's tag. If the tags don't match — because of a use-after-free, buffer overflow, or other memory corruption — the app crashes instead of performing the unsafe access.

## What Vulnerabilities It Mitigates

- **Use-after-free** — accessing memory after it has been freed (the freed memory gets a new tag)
- **Heap buffer overflow** — accessing memory beyond the allocated region (adjacent allocations have different tags)
- **Out-of-bounds access** — reading or writing past array boundaries
- **Double-free** — freeing memory that has already been freed

## How to Enable

**Xcode UI:** Signing & Capabilities > Enhanced Security > Memory Safety > click "Enable Hardware Memory Tagging"

**Entitlement:** `com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations`

### Soft Mode.

Soft mode produces **simulated crashes** (crash reports) instead of actually terminating the app. Use this to find memory bugs without impacting users.

**Entitlement:** `com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations.soft-mode`

Soft mode is enabled by default when you first enable hardware memory tagging. After reviewing crash reports and fixing issues, disable soft mode for enforcement.

**Xcode UI:** Under Memory Safety, deselect "Enable Soft Mode for Memory Tagging"

### Debugging Diagnostics

For detailed diagnostics during development, navigate to Scheme Editor > Run > Diagnostics > enable "Hardware Memory Tagging".

### Additional Entitlements

- `com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations.enable-pure-data` — extends tagging to pure data allocations
- `com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations.no-tagged-receive` — prevents receiving tagged pointers from other processes

## Code Changes Required

None for basic adoption. Hardware memory tagging is a runtime enforcement mechanism — no source code annotations are needed. However, code with latent memory bugs will safely abort (or produce simulated crash reports in soft mode).

## How to Disable

**Xcode UI:** Under Memory Safety, deselect "Enable Hardware Memory Tagging"

Remove the `com.apple.security.hardened-process.checked-allocations` entitlement.

## Platform Availability

- **Hardware:** Available on iPhone and iPad with an A19 chip or later, and Mac and Apple Vision Pro with an M5 chip or later. (The iPhone 17 family is the first A19 generation.)

## Performance and Stability Impact

- **Performance:** Moderate overhead due to hardware tag checking on every memory access. Profile your app.
- **Stability:** Code with latent memory bugs **will crash**. Use soft mode first to identify and fix issues before enforcing.
- **Adoption path:** Enable soft mode > review simulated crash reports > fix memory bugs > disable soft mode for production.
