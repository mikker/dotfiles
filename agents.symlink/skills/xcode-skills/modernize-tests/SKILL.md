# Modernize Tests

Test modernization refers to two potential actions: migrating from XCTest to Swift Testing, and updating existing Swift Testing tests to use recommended patterns.

XCTests should be migrated to Swift Testing when possible. However, not all XCTests can be migrated to Swift Testing.
- UI tests (those that use XCUIAutomation) cannot be written with Swift Testing, and must remain XCTests.
- XCTests that use the `measure { ... }` family of APIs for performance measurement cannot be migrated. However, other test methods within an XCTestCase that do not use XCTest performance APIs can be migrated.

## Migration Reference

### Imports

Replace `import XCTest` with `import Testing`. A file can import both if it contains mixed test content during incremental migration.

When removing `import XCTest`, check whether the file uses Foundation types (URL, CharacterSet, ProcessInfo, Data, etc.). XCTest re-exports Foundation, so add `import Foundation` if needed.

### Test Classes to Suites

Remove `XCTestCase` inheritance. Prefer structs over classes:

- `final class FoodTruckTests: XCTestCase { ... }` -> `struct FoodTruckTests { ... }`

### Move setUp/tearDown code to init/deinit

Replace `override func setUp()` with `init()` (can be `async throws`). Replace `override func tearDown()` with `deinit`. If `deinit` is needed, use
`actor` or `final class` instead of `struct` (since structs have no `deinit`). Change stored properties to not use implicitly-unwrapped optional
types, and move their initial assignment from `setUp` to either be initialized inline or, if the initialization is complex, in an initializer.

```
struct MyTests {
    var fixture = Fixture()
    mutating func `Fixture behaves as expected`() {
        #expect(fixture.doSomething())
    }
}
```

Avoid pulling instance variables into function bodies; this can cause noise. Swift Testing reinvokes the initializer fresh before each test runs.
If the test mutates an instance variable with value semantics, you may need to mark the test function `mutating`.

### Test Methods

Replace the `test` name prefix with the `@Test` attribute. If the resulting test name includes multiple camelCase words,
use a raw identifier with the test name in sentence case.

- `func testEngineDoesNotStall() { ... }` -> `@Test func `Engine does not stall`() { ... }`
- `func testIgnition() { ... }` -> `@Test func ignition() { ... }`

Test functions can be `async`, `throws`, or `async throws`, and can be isolated to a global actor with `@MainActor`.

### Assertions to Expectations

When migrating a test from XCTest to Swift Testing, apply these mappings:

`XCTAssert(x)`, `XCTAssertTrue(x)` -> `#expect(x)`
`XCTAssertFalse(x)` -> `#expect(!x)`
`XCTAssertNil(x)` -> `#expect(x == nil)`
`XCTAssertNotNil(x)` -> `#expect(x != nil)`
`XCTAssertEqual(x, y)` -> `#expect(x == y)`
`XCTAssertNotEqual(x, y)` -> `#expect(x != y)`
`XCTAssertIdentical(x, y)` -> `#expect(x === y)`
`XCTAssertNotIdentical(x, y)` -> `#expect(x !== y)`
`XCTAssertGreaterThan(x, y)` -> `#expect(x > y)`
`XCTAssertGreaterThanOrEqual(x, y)` -> `#expect(x >= y)`
`XCTAssertLessThanOrEqual(x, y)` -> `#expect(x <= y)`
`XCTAssertLessThan(x, y)` -> `#expect(x < y)`
`try XCTUnwrap(x)` -> `try #require(x)`

There is no direct equivalent for `XCTAssertEqual(_:_:accuracy:)`; use floating point math directly.

### Errors

When the error type is `Equatable` and the exact value is known, prefer to check the specific error value.

```
XCTAssertThrowsError(try f())
```
->
```
#expect(throws: (any Error).self) {
    try f()
}
```

```
XCTAssertThrowsError(try f()) { error in
    XCTAssertEqual(error, specificError)
}
```
->
```
#expect(throws: specificError) {
    try f()
}
```

```
XCTAssertThrowsError(try f()) { error in
    // Check error
}
```
->
```
let error = #expect(throws: (any Error).self) {
    try f()
}
// Check error
```

```
XCTAssertNoThrow(try f())
```
->
```
#expect(throws: Never.self) {
    try f()
}
```

### continueAfterFailure

By default `continueAfterFailure` is true, which means expectations do not halt the test run.
Some XCTestCases set `continueAfterFailure = false`, which means the `XCTAssert` family of functions
will throw Objective-C exceptions that halt the test execution.

When a test method sets `continueAfterFailure = false`, all subsequent assertions need to be `try #require(x)`
instead of `#expect(x)` to preserve this behavior. When adding `try #require(x)`, add `throws` to the affected methods.

When `continueAfterFailure = false` is set in `setUp`, the conversion to `try #require(x)` must apply
to **all assertions in all test methods** in that class.

### Promote `Issue.record`/`XCTFail` to expectations

Wherever it is not disruptive, convert usage of `Issue.record` or `XCTFail` to #expect or #require,
depending if the test exits after (taking `continueAfterFailure` into account).

In some cases, the source of the expectation itself is sufficient to explain the failure,
and the comment would be redundant.

For example, the following structures should be converted as such:

```
guard let object = somethingOptional() else {
    Issue.record("Could not get object")
    return
}

guard object.isAvailable() else {
    Issue.record("Object not available")
    return
}

if !object.performOperation() {
    Issue.record("Failed to perform operation")
}
```
->
```
let object = try #require(somethingOptional(), "Could not get object")
try #require(object.isAvailable())
#expect(object.performOperation())
```

### Asynchronous Expectations to Confirmations

Replace `XCTestExpectation` + `fulfill()` + `await fulfillment(of:)` with `confirmation()`:

```swift
// Before
let exp = expectation(description: "...")
handler = { exp.fulfill() }
doWork()
await fulfillment(of: [exp])

// After
await confirmation("...") { confirm in
    handler = { confirm() }
    doWork()
}
```

For `assertForOverFulfill = false` with an `expectedFulfillmentCount`, use a range:
`await confirmation("...", expectedCount: 10...) { confirm in ... }`

### Skipping Tests

Replace `XCTSkipIf`/`XCTSkipUnless` with traits on the test or suite:

- `try XCTSkipIf(condition)` -> `@Test(.disabled(if: condition))`
- `try XCTSkipUnless(condition)` -> `@Test(.enabled(if: condition))`

Replace `throw XCTSkip("reason")` mid-test with `try Test.cancel("reason")`.

When a skip checks OS version or platform availability, replace it with an `@available` attribute on the test function instead of `.enabled(if:)`.

### Known Issues

Replace `XCTExpectFailure("...", ...) { ... }` with `withKnownIssue("...") { ... }`.

For intermittent failures, replace `.nonStrict()` option (or the shorthand `strict: false` parameter) with `isIntermittent: true`.

For conditional/matching: use `when:` and `matching:` parameters:

```swift
withKnownIssue("...") {
    try riskyOperation()
} when: {
    shouldExpectFailure
} matching: { issue in
    issue.error != nil
}
```

### Concurrency and Serial Execution

XCTest runs synchronous tests on the main actor and sequentially within a suite by default. Swift Testing runs all test functions on an arbitrary task
and in parallel. Add `@MainActor` only if a test explicitly relied on main-actor isolation in its XCTest form, and add `@Suite(.serialized)` if
tests depend on shared state.

### Attachments

Replace `XCTAttachment` + `self.add(attachment)` with `Attachment.record(value)`. The attached type must conform to `Attachable` (automatic for
`Codable` and `NSSecureCoding` types when Foundation is imported).

## Modernization Guidelines

- When migrating from XCTest, migrate one test class at a time. A file can contain both XCTest and Swift Testing tests during migration.
- Prefer `struct` for suites unless `deinit` (tearDown) is needed, in which case use `actor` or `final class`.
- Remove the `test` prefix from method names when adding `@Test`. For lengthier test names which read like a sentence, use raw identifier syntax to
improve readability, e.g. `@Test func `Authenticate, fetch summary, then check count`() { ... }`.
- Use raw identifier syntax only for multi-word names that read like a sentence.
- When migrating `setUp`, convert implicitly-unwrapped optional properties to non-optional properties initialized in-place, or in `init` if initialization is complex, may throw, or is async.
- Look for explicit `XCTFail`/`Issue.record` calls that could be converted to `#expect` or `#require`
- Do not change `try #require` calls into `#expect`; this changes the behavior of tests.
- Add `@MainActor` only to tests that explicitly relied on XCTest's implicit main-actor isolation. Do not add it unnecessarily.
- Look for tests that loop over inputs or many repeated tests with the same logic and convert them to parameterized tests using `@Test(arguments:)`.
- For suites with shared mutable state between tests, add `@Suite(.serialized)` and consider using `actor` or `class` instead of `struct`.
- Do not introduce usage of underscore-prefixed symbols such as `#_sourceLocation`; only use public API.
  For source locations, always use the full `SourceLocation(fileID:filePath:line:column:)` initializer.
- If the test suite already uses #_sourceLocation, do not replace the existing usage as part of modernization.
- Split this work over multiple agents if necessary if the modernization task is complex
